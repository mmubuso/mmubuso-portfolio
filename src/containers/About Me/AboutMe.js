                        In the past year I've embarked on a journey to become a software developer </p>
                    <p>
                        A friend of mine encouraged me to learn  programming. So I grabbed a book on Java and began diving into it for 6 months. I loved It !! So I decided to fully invest in myself and attend the General Assembly software bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>
                        I would love to bring in my ravenous appetite for learning quickly into such a corporation.</p>
